#### Hi! my name is Erric Rapsing, I'm a software architecture enthusiast.
made this to share about my experiences in software development career.

#### More about me?
I'm a cat lover, if you do love cats then were good :D  
sometimes I play acoustic guitar to have serenity

<br/>

#### Why can't find any existing project details here
My current job is also my very first software development career, I do have signed NDA with them,
maybe in the future if they allow me to add the project details here. :)
